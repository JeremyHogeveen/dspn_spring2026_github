    "  * Identify a clean work surface or counter.\n",
    "  * Collect 1 cutting board, 1 butter knife, 1 jar peanut butter, 1 jar jam, and 1 bag of bread; place each item on the work surface side by side.\n",

    "  * Place the two bread slices flat, side by side, on the cutting board.\n",
    "  * Unscrew the lid of peanut butter jar.\n",
    "  * Pick up butter knife handle with right hand.\n",
    "  * Insert the blade of the butter knife into peanut butter jar, pushing it beneath the surface of the peanut butter.\n",
    "  * Scoop out approximately 2 tbsp of peanut butter with the butter knife.\n",
    "  * Spread the peanut butter evenly on the flat side of one slice of bread, covering its surface area.\n",
    "  * Scrape off any excess peanut butter on the rim of the RB jar.\n",
    "  * Close peanut butter jar lid.\n",
