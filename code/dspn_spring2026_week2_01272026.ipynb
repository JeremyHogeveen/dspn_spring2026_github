    "## 1.1 What is Unix shell?\n",
    "* For computers, the \"graphical user interface (GUI)\"—like Windows, or macOS—creates a set of visual icons and menus that enable you to interact with the machine to perform various preset operations.\n",
    "* The Unix shell is a program that allows you to control your computer by typing commands rather than clicking around.\n",
    "  * <i>Bash</i> is its main \"language\" (or, depending on the OS/user preferences: Zsh, sh, or tcsh)\n",
    "  * A fundamental tool for controlling the way the computer executes programs, including in data analysis!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Why Unix shell?\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can glue together various aspects of a pipeline.\n",
    "  * Speaks directly to the operating system, so it can connect various pieces of a data analysis routine.\n",
    "  * e.g. if a routine involves a csv, a nifti, a Python script, an R script, and a git repository -- all of these can be stitched together easily by Unix shell!\n",
    "* It builds your comfort moving around the file system.\n",
    "  * It encourages you to truly understand how and/or where your computer stores information (directories, paths, permissions, etc.).\n",
    "* Gateway to high performance computing (HPC; e.g. <a href=\"https://carc.unm.edu/\">UNM's CARC</a>)\n",
    "  * I have done projects where parallelizing tasks on a high performance compute cluster can lead to >1000% time savings. Getting some familiarity with Unix shell can make it less intimidating to learn to run jobs on CARC's HPC nodes!\n",
    " \n",
    "## 1.3 Accessing / Using Unix shell?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mac: Terminal application\n",
    "  * Spotlight --> type \"Terminal\" <i>or</i> Finder --> Applications --> Utilities --> \"Terminal\"\n",
    "    * Suggestion: Put it on your Dock for ease of access!\n",
